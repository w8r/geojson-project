# geojson-project

## API

*`geojsonProject(geojson, func, context)`*
* `geojson` is `Feature` or `FeatureCollection`
* `func` is the project function, takes in one coordinate pair,
         returns it transformed
* `context` _optional_ - transform function `this`

returns transformed copy of GeoJSON

## Usage
```js
var geojsonProject = require('geojson-project');

geojsonProject({
  type: 'FeatureCollection',
    features: [{
      type: 'Feature',
      properties: {a : 1},
      geometry: {
        type: 'Point',
        coordinates: [6, 6]
      }
    }, {
      type: 'Feature',
      properties: {a : 2},
      geometry: {
        type: 'Point',
        coordinates: [4, 4]
      }
    }]
  }, function(coord) {
    return [coords[0]/2, coords[1]/2];
  });

```

will result in

```js
{
  type: 'FeatureCollection',
  features: [{
    type: 'Feature',
    properties: {a : 1},
    geometry: {
      type: 'Point',
      coordinates: [3, 3]
    }
  }, {
    type: 'Feature',
    properties: {a : 2},
    geometry: {
      type: 'Point',
      coordinates: [2, 2]
    }
  }]
